End-to-End build of the Server Info Page in Battlefield 4

Getting Started with Server Info Pgae in Battlefield 4
 
This guide will help you set up a local development environment and run the application.

Prerequisites:

    Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system. You can download them from https://nodejs.org/en

Installation:

    Clone the Repository:

    git clone https://github.com/CodeineX/Battlefield-4-server.git

Install Dependencies:

Navigate to the project directory:

    cd Battlefield-4-server

Install the required dependencies using npm: 

    npm install

Development Server:

Start the Development Server:

Run the following command to start a local development server:

    cd backend
    node server.js

In a new terminal, 

    cd battlefield4
    npm start

    (If you're using yarn, the command might be yarn start)

This will typically start the server on [this](http://localhost:3000/battlefield4) (or a different port depending on your configuration). You can then open this URL in your web browser to view the application.

     
Additional Notes:

    This is a general guide, and specific commands or configurations might vary depending on your project setup.
    Refer to the project documentation (if any) for further details.
